# The MNRAS template and style file

The is the standard MNRAS template and style file used to prepare papers that are to be submitted to MNRAS, as provided by the CTAN website. The main motivation for keeping this here is to keep a permanent record of this README, which outlines which extra latex packages need to be installed on top of BasicTex for this to compile.

## Getting started:

I prefer to not install the full texLive distribution, as it is HUGE! Instead, I install BasicTex, but this requires me to add additional packages as I see fit. For this I use the `tlmgr` package manager that comes with BasixTex.

The MNRAS style requires the following:
I already had `siunitx` and  `sectsty` packages installed prior to compiling the MNRAS template for the first time on a new machine. Next, I had to:
```
sudo tlmgr install kastrup
sudo tlmgr install newtx
sudo tlmgr install fontaxes
sudo tlmgr install tex-gyre
sudo tlmgr install txfonts
sudo tlmgr install boondox
```

After which, the template compiled correctly. If it complains, you can use the following to search for the package you need to install using:
```
tlmgr 
```
